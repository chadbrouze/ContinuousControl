## Enviroment Details

This environment is called the Reacher Environment. It consists of a double-jointed arm can move to target locations. When the agent's hand is on the target location, it receives a reward of +0.1. The state-space consists of 33 variables corresponding to the arm's position, rotation, velocity, and angular velocities. The action space is a 4 number vector representing torque applicable to two joints, and every entry in the action vector should be a number between -1 and 1. The environment is solved once the agent receives an average score of 30 over 100 consecutive episodes. Currently, robotic arms in factories require a very tightly controlled environment. This technology can serve as a solution to more versatile machinery.
